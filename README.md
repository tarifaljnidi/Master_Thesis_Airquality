# Master_Thesis_Airquality
This thesis integrates sensor network  and machine learning techniques for air quality monitoring.
- Proposing a system that provides :
- Interpolation model that creates air quality information maps, and also probability maps of exceedance for PM2.5 concentration over the Luxembourg region, that show poor air quality spots so that the people are notified and can avoid those areas.
- A forecasting model to estimate the value of air quality level in the future, and use it as input to early warning system. This system can provide emergency warnings about air pollution heavy incidents, and it is an important part of the whole monitoring system. 
- A classification model to provide recommended rules of decision to the government
as a solution to reduce air pollution based on future pollution levels predicated by this model. This can guide the making of appropriate decisions in situations when pollution level exceed the recommended threshold.
